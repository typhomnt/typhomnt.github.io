      <title>Animation Transfer</title>

      <description>One main goal of my thesis is to find a way to animate 3D characters using physical props as an animation tool. The motivation is to create an animation sequence from a play with figurines, trying to reproduce what the player was imagining.
Space Time Doodle Transfer examples Below, I show transfered space-time doodles into animation sequences. It is important to note that all actions were learnt for the two first examples as well as for the garden example.</description>

      <title>Animation Transfer for two characters: Part 1</title>

      <description>In the animation transfer article, I presented a method to create a animation sequence from a 6D trajectory. This method is centered around one character at a time. Here, I propose a way to extend it in order to take into account multiple characters and their interactions.
Experiment 1: Don Juan and Ghost Scene This first experiment was done in the scope of an intership student&amp;rsquo;s project. The goal was to test our system in a context where the script was already written and where two chacters were &amp;ldquo;interacting&amp;rdquo; without any contact.</description>

      <title>Laban Effort Animation Transfer</title>

      <description>One important aspect of my thesis work is adding expressivity to an input &amp;ldquo;neutral&amp;rdquo; animation. In our work, we decided to take the Laban Effort space as the main representation of the expressivity. This 4D space is divided into Space, Time, Weight and Flow axis. The Space axis describes how direct or indirect a movment is, Time describes if a movment is rather sudden or sustained while Weight differenciate Light from Strong motions.</description>

      <description>My main interest of research is to find an intuitive way of animating characters. During my thesis untitled &amp;ldquo;Performence Transfer: Animating Characters by Playing and Acting&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to find a method for creating expressive character animation sequences using 6D trajectories which contain position and orientation data of a physical prop trajectory (such as HTC Vive controllers). This work tackle three problems: Creating an animation sequence using one 6D trajectory, recognizing and transfering motion qualties and create multi character animations in a storytelling context.</description>

      <description>SkyEngine is yet another game engine I am working on together with co-workers and former collegues. The main goal of this engine is to implement recent research work, to make video game and animated movie content easier to create. I would like to thank Julien Daval, Guillaume Cordonnier, Valentin Touzeau, Pierre Casati and Remi Galan Alfonso for contributing to this framework.</description>
